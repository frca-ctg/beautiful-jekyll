## Description
The goal of this exercise is to findout if our friends are in some specific areas. You can [see it here](/client.html)

## Solution components

1. Everyone has the [Owntracks](http://owntracks.org/booklet/) application on his/her GSM.
1. Owntracks publishes location data and region events to a private [AWS MQTT broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html).
1. On a micro EC2 instance, we run an EC2 server which is connected to the AWS-MQTT browser over the MQTT protocol, and with client browsers using the Websocket protocol. 
   The same server also serves this webpage over HTTP. The server saves the mqtt messages for analytics, maintains the current locations and regions,
   and broadcasts current state to all browser clients whenever something changes.

The server implementation is based on a number of Python libraries:
- [Paho MQTT](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) for the MQTT client
- [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) for the HTTP server
- [Autobahn](http://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the websocket server

The browser uses javascript
- [Websocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)
- jQuery for DOM manipulation


## Server Functionalities:

| Feature | Status | 
| :---------------------------------------------------- |:--- |
| Connect to Aws MQTT securely and reliably | OK |
| Listen for HTTP requests from browsers | OK |
| Setup websocket connection with browsers | OK |
| Subscribe to owntracks/# topic | OK |
| Save mqtt messages in file | OK |
| Save mqtt messages on DynamoDB | - |
| Save current Friend Location/Region | OK |
| Broadcast All current Loc/Reg to connected websockets | OK |

## Client browser functionalities:

| Feature | Status | 
| :---------------------------------------------------- |:--- |
| Establish websocket connection | OK |
| Show received websocket messages on screen | POC |
| Button to send websocket message | POC | 

## Remaining to be done:

| Feature | Status | 
| :---------------------------------------------------- |:--- |
| Connect over HTTPS ||
| Use public IP and DNS ||
| Nice UI ||
| Ansible to provision in AWS and to configure||



## Notes: TO IMPROVE !!!

Currently, I have two different http servers in the system which are both working for tests:
- server_fc3.py which contains the socket server and the mqtt client and responds on port 8080
- server server.py which is a simple http server on port 8000.

To start I currently do this:
```bash
#first time only:
cd ~/jekyll
git clone https://github.com/frca-ctg/frca-ctg.github.io.git

#after each change in github
cd ~/jekyll/frca-ctg.github.io
git pull
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build -d ~/work/web
```

To start the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from twisted.web.server import Site
from twisted.web.static import File
from twisted.internet import endpoints
from twisted.python import log
from twisted.internet import reactor

if __name__ == '__main__':

    import sys
    log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
    resource = File('_site')
    factory = Site(resource)
    endpoint = endpoints.TCP4ServerEndpoint(reactor, 8000)
    endpoint.listen(factory)
    reactor.run()
```
